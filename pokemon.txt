1. Player chooses the starting pokemon 
    -Pick Potentials
        -Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu 
    - If player closes and opens again, they can use their previous pokemon if they saved it
 
2. Computer randomly chooses a pokemon as an opponent
    - this would randomly pick the pokemon
	   - the attacks would also be randomized based on element
    - player would get random attacks based on their pokemon as well

3. The Battle 

    ~ Player ~

        -turn based system
    	    - one action per turn for both player & enemies

        -attack UI {player options}
            -randomized amount of attacks (only one or two attacks)
            -account for elemental differences

        -inventory {player options}
            -potions; would be based off of the ratio of health lost to health kept

    ~ AI ~

        -Enemy Attack
	    -randomixed attacks choices
	    - account for elemental differences
    
        -Enemy Flees
	    - Once health down a certain percentage, has chance to flee, gets bigger the less health it has

    ~ UI ~
	- Text for now
        -ASCII Art {MAYBE}

4. End of Battle
    - Restart new pokemon
