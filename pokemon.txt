    - this would randomly pick the pokemon
	   - the attacks would also be randomized based on element
    - player would get random attacks based on their pokemon as well

3. The Battle 


	Mathmatics for damage:
	((2*Level(1) +10)/250 * (attack/defense) * power +2) * modifier

	modifier = STAB * type * critical * other * (random [.85, 1])
	stab = 1.5 * base damage
    ~ Player ~

        -turn based system
    	    - one action per turn for both player & enemies

        -attack UI {player options}
            -randomized amount of attacks (only one or two attacks)
            -account for elemental differences

        -inventory {player options}
            -potions; would be based off of the ratio of health lost to health kept 

        -flee {player options}
	    - player can have their pokemon attempt to flee from battle
    
    ~ AI ~

        -Enemy Attack
	    -randomixed attacks choices
	    - account for elemental differences
    
        -Enemy Flees
	    - Once health down a certain percentage, has chance to flee, gets bigger the less health it has

        -No inventory; no potions 

    ~ UI ~
	- Text for now
        -ASCII Art {MAYBE}

4. End of Battle
    - Restart new pokemon
	    - Would then just restart the whole system
    - Continue with the same pokemon 
    	    - Would just keep the same stats
